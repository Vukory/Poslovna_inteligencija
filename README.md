# Predicting Optimal Industrial Facility Locations Using Machine Learning

This paper explores the application of machine learning in predicting optimal locations for industrial facilities, focusing on sustainability and economic efficiency. Linear regression models forecast temperatures and solar radiation, while random forest regression models predict CO2 emissions, energy production, GDP, and population growth across European countries. The models provide a decision-making framework that ranks countries based on climate stability, sustainability, and economic growth. The flexible models allow for criteria adjustments to meet business needs.
